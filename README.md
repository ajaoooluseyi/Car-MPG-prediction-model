# Car-MPG-prediction-model
  This is a model that predicts a car's fuel efficiency using its miles per gallon (MPG) consumption of fuel using the scikit learn module in python. The model was trained using data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

 # About the dataset
  The data comprises of some technical specs of some cars.
  The data concerns car fuel consumption in miles per gallon,to be predicted in terms of 8 attributes in 398 instances.
  ## The attribute information: 
  - MPG - Milieage/Miles Per Galon 
  - Cylinders - Number of cylinders in the car engine. 
  - Displacement - engine displacement of the car 
  - Horsepower - rate of the engine performance 
  - Weight - the weight of a car 
  - Acceleration - the acceleration of a car 
  - Model Year - year the car was manufactured 
  - Origin - the origin of the car 
 
 # Programming language
  Python
  
 # Benefits
 - Provide a means to quickly check a car's fuel efficiency.
 - Improve transparency in buying and selling of cars
